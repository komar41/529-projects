           <div class="about-me__body">
               <p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, I am Pursuing Ph.D. in Computer Science from UIC and working part-time as a Research Assistant at the Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL) and also as a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science department. My research interests lie in developing techniques that allows for interactive analysis of large-scale data combining methods from Visualization, Data Management and Applied Machine Learning.</p>
               <p style="text-align: justify;">In my spare time, I like to watch some TV series or listen to music. I used to travel a lot, but lately, that is not the case. I can also play guitar and hum a few songs, although I am not very good at it.</p>
