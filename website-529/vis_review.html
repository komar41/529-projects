            <h3>What is its purpose: </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The visualizations here give insights into how effective Covid lockdown restrictions and other policies were in terms of reducing human movement. It also gives an idea about how people across the world work; live; and where they visit. The line chart shows the change in visitor numbers to specific categories of location (e.g. grocery stores; parks; train stations). The change is relative to baseline days before the pandemic outbreak. Instead of time range, if users choose a specific date, they will be able to see the percentage of visitor change for that specific date since the pandemic. Users can also choose a country using the input option from the top left.</p>
            <h3>What works in these visualizations?: </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The visualizations are very successful in displaying information and conveying it in an easy manner to the viewer. The information is displayed very easily and the incorporation of colors makes it easy to understand and comprehend. The color choice is also good because it is easy on the eyes and isn't too bright so that it stands out.</p>
